###Key for edges:
* All edges are listed clockwise from top to left
* 1 for the circle
* 2 for the inward pointing arrow
* 3 for the outward pointing arrow
* 4 for the cross 
And the corresponding negative values for the inward edges

### Key for possible rotations (rotation value preceded by an r)
* 0 with male edges top and right 
* 1 with male edges right and bottom (90 degree roation)
* 2 with male edges bottom and left (180 degree rotation)
* 3 with male edges left and top (270 degree rotation)

### Example
So the piece 43-4-2r3 has an male cross, male outward pointing arrow, a female cross, and a female inward pointing arrow, with the male edges facing left and top.
